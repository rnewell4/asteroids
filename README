This program was initially created as a final project for my Intro to Programming class with two other people.
I have since gone back and edited somethings. After editing all of the physics, collision, and wrapping code is my own as 
well as all of the Ship, and Asteroid classes. I also helped write most of the main function and tweaked the thrust, debris,
and missile classes.
